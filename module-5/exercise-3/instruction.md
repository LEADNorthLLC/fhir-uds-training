# Module 5: Exercise 3


# Navigating the FHIR documentation

***To start this exercise you must first complete Module 5 Exercise 1.***

**Objective:** The goal of this exercise is to learn how to access InterSystems FHIR Annotations.

First, navigate to the Home screen of your IRIS instance. You can do this by clicking the Home button on the top bar or just click on the following link:

	http://localhost:32783/csp/sys/%25CSP.Portal.Home.zen?$NAMESPACE=%25SYS

Now, navigate to the **Health** tab from the Home screen.

To the right of the word **Foundation,** click on the FHIRDEMO namespace.

On the left navigation bar, click **Schema Documentation** and then **FHIR Annotations.**

On this screen, you can access all of the InterSystems FHIR documentation. Note the three different drop-downs you have access to. As you use these you will notice that only one drop down can be active at one time. However, the first two dropdowns work together and are specific to FHIR to SDA3 mapping information while the third dropdown is for SDA3 to FHIR mapping information. You'll also notice that the each dropdown may include FHIR resource types, data types AND other structural element types. Keep that in mind as you use this page.

**Tasks:**
1. Find Medication using the **FHIR4** dropdown.
2. Find Patient using the **Category** dropdown.
3. Find ObservationGroup using the **HS.SDA3** dropdown. Note the differences and similarities in the three drop downs.



4. Find the mapping from the Medication section of SDA3 to FHIR. Use whatever dropdown you deem appropriate.
5. Find the Quantity.system **SDA3 Target** field using whatever dropdown you deem appropriate.
6. Find SearchParameter:multipleAnd **FHIR4 Data Type** using whatever dropdown you deem appropriate.
